# Dream-On

I've long had an interest in music and software, so VCV Rack was a natural attraction. It feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to creating some VCV Rack modules. On the other hand, I am retired (from a career including software design and implemenation dating back to 1978) and don't feel up to the "learning curve" involved in creating VCV modules. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out. In the meantime, as I already had some Javascript experience, I thought I'd implement some ideas in the VCV PROTOTYPE module.
