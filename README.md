# Dream-On

**UPDATE:** August 16, 2020 -- The javascript file and the demo patch have been updated. There was a bug in the Javascript that showed up when it was loaded into a new instance (or newly initialized instance) of the PROTOTYPE module. This would cause the initialization process to fail before completion. As the patch was using "already initilialized" modules, it ran fine but if someone saved the Javascript file and reloaded it into a new instance of PROTOTYPE the error would occur there.

I've an interest in music and software, so VCV Rack was a natural attraction. I go way back with programming (my first ever "commercial" software was a time card data entry program written in Basic for the brand new (at the time) Radio Shack TRS-80 (A whopping 4K of memory! And a cassette tape recorder in place of a disk drive). It feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to creating some VCV Rack modules. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out.
