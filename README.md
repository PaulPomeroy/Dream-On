# Dream-On

I've long had an interest in music and software, so it feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to **VCV Rack** and to creating some VCV modules. On the other hand, I am retired (from a career including software design and implemenation dating back to 1978) and haven't felt all that up to taking on the "learning curve" involved in creating VCV modules. However, as I already had some Javascript experience, I thought I'd implement some ideas in the **VCV PROTOTYPE** module. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out.
