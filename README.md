# Dream-On

I've an interest in music and software. VCV Rack was a natural attraction. I go way back with programming (my first ever "commercial" software was a time card data entry program written in Basic for the brand new (at the time) Radio Shack TRS-80. Most of my experience had little to do with the object-oriented languages (like C++) although I did write in Java for a while, mainly to learn what all the fuss was about. I learned (a little) Java by writing a freeware application called ColorWrite. If you were doing web development work, especially on a Mac, back around the year 2001, you might have come across it. Much to my surprise is was written up in a magazine (Macworld, as I recall) and then included in a web design book.

All that ... to say it feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to creating some VCV Rack modules. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out.
