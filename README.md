# Dream-On

I've an interest in music and software, so VCV Rack was a natural attraction. I go way back with programming. My first ever "commercial" software was a time card data entry program written in Basic for the brand new, at the time, Radio Shack TRS-80 (which had a whopping 4K of memory and a cassette tape recorder instead of a disk drive). It feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to creating some VCV Rack modules. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out.
