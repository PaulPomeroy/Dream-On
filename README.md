# Dream-On

I've an interest in music and software, so VCV Rack was a natural attraction. I go way back with programming (my first ever "commercial" software was a time card data entry program written in Basic for the brand new (at the time) Radio Shack TRS-80 (A whopping 4K of memory! And a cassette tape recorder in place of a disk drive). It feels only natural to me that I should be drawn to creating some VCV Rack modules. I've no idea where this will lead at the moment. I guess we'll find out.
